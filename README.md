# `stm32c0xx-hal`

ðŸš§ Work in progress ðŸš§

_stm32c0xx-hal_ contains a multi device hardware abstraction on top of the
peripheral access API for the STMicro STM32C0 series microcontrollers. The
selection of the MCU is done by feature gates, typically specified by board
support crates.

## Usage

This crate will eventually contain support for multiple microcontrollers in the
stm32c0 family. Which specific microcontroller you want to build for has to be
specified with a feature, for example `stm32c011`.

### Building an Example

If you are compiling the crate on its own for development or running examples,
specify your microcontroller on the command line. For example:

```
cargo build --example blinky --features stm32c011
```

### Using as a Dependency

When using this crate as a dependency in your project, the microcontroller can
be specified as part of the `Cargo.toml` definition.

```
[dependencies.stm32c0xx-hal]
version = "0.0.0"
features = ["rt", "stm32c011"]
```
